# Project Labyrinth

This is a pair project made by Lisa Johansson  & Maria Wellander. The aim was to build a text-based adventure game app that retrieves a list of actions from the backend and presents them to the user as interactable items.

## The problem
We approached the problem through making a Google Jamboard and a Kanban board. It was a great way to get a hold of the assignement and to understand what to do.
Firstly, the plan was to start with coding the starter code. Secondly, to code all functionalities. Finally, to add the styling/UX/responsiveness.
We used JavaScript, Redux, Redux Toolkit, thunks, CSS, HTML, Postman. We also used Lottie for the loading animation.
If we had more time we would have wanted to style each room/state based on the description.
